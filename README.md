## FAQs

### Why?

Like everything in this universe Mastodon servers are ephemeral. They often come to life in a highly energetic moment, glow for some time and than vanish out of existence again because some update goes wrong or human things happen.
If you want your toots to be hosted after your server is long gone you could use this repository to generate a static website with your content.

### How?

I used the wonderful static page generator [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) for this.
Eleventy was a perfect fit for this! Not only does it support multiple templating languages and other nice features, it also supports dynamic [JS data files](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-js/) so the content can directly get pulled out of the zipped archive.
